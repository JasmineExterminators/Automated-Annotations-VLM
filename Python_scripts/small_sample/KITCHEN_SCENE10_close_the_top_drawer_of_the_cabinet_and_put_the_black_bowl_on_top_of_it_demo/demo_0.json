        "reasoning": "My current goal is to close the top drawer of the cabinet, which I observe on my left side and is currently open. I am initiating the action by moving my arm from its resting position towards the drawer. I can visually identify the drawer and its handle, and I'm guiding my end-effector towards that general area."

        "reasoning": "I have successfully brought my arm closer to the target drawer. Now, I need to perform fine adjustments to precisely position my open gripper for grasping the handle. I am lowering my arm and carefully aligning the center of my gripper with the horizontal bar that serves as the drawer handle. The handle is now directly in my gripper's line of sight."

        "reasoning": "I have a firm and secure grasp on the drawer handle. My next step is to push the drawer horizontally forward, guiding it into the cabinet structure until it is fully closed. I am applying a consistent force and visually monitoring the drawer's movement as it slides into its closed position. I observe the drawer front becoming flush with the cabinet face."
