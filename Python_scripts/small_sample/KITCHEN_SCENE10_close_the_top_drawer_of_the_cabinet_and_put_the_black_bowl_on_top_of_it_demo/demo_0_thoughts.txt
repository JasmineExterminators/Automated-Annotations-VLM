Prompt for Gemini: 
    You are a robot performing the task KITCHEN_SCENE10_close_the_top_drawer_of_the_cabinet_and_put_the_black_bowl_on_top_of_it_demo. You are provided with a pdf with the frames of the trajectory pasted. At the top of each page is the time each frame is recorded in seconds. 
      
    Segment the video provided in the pdf into detailed actions and detailed reasonings the robot is performing. Remember, the goal of the robot's task is: KITCHEN_SCENE10_close_the_top_drawer_of_the_cabinet_and_put_the_black_bowl_on_top_of_it_demo.  You should record the observation of the scene (as the first field), the action the robot is performing, a reasoning for the action, a start time of the action, end time of the action, and duration of the action. The reasonings must be written in first person, thinking as if you are the robot.
    
    The left side shows the front view and the right side shows the view on the grippers of the robot. Each frame is spaced 0.05 seconds apart. This video has a length of 9.85 seconds.
    
    The action annotation is relatively fine-grained. For example, grasping is divided into 2 actions: reach, close the gripper. If the task description highlights spatial relationships, or if there are multiple objects from the same category, then your annotation should also contain these spatial / directional info, such as left / right, front / back. For the reasoning part, you only need to provide key steps. Focus on key visual features that help you identify the current situation. For example, the robot "is holding sth." or "has not reached sth." Remember that Gemini's visual understanding is worse than reasoning ability, so help Gemini more with visual info.
    
    Include more detailed information about the object's spatial relationships and the robot position. For instance, "I am positioned next to the OBJECT" and "the OBJECT is on the left side of the scene." There should be a paragraph of reasoning.
